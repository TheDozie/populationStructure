## What's a Population Pyramid

- Wikipedia: a graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age groups in a population (typically that of a country or region of the world)
- Ploted with 5-year age classes on vertical axis and population count or percentages in horizontal bars
- Age-class axis in middle, males to the left, females to the right
- Population counts decrease with increasing age classes
- Therefore the shape is a *pyramid*, thus the name

## Example Population Pyramid

Population Pyramid of Africa in 2014 produced with Minato Nakazawa's pyramid package and data from UN's World Population Prospects.

## Comparing Population Pyramids

- We sometimes need to compare population pyramids:
+ Different countries or regions at the same time
+ Different epochs for the same country or region
- The only way to compare standard population pyramids is to plot them side by side for visual comparison
- Why not plot with lines that can be overlaid to easily make comparison
- This shiny application does that

## The Application

- The user interface presents a drop down list of all African countries
- A slider input allows two years to be selected
- Output:
+ Population pyramids (line version) for the base year, current year and comparison year (default: 1950, thisYear, 2100)
+ Evolution of broad population classes of children (ages 0-14), adult (15-64) and old (65+)
+ Comparative table of key population facts
